Factorial
============
Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number.

Background
---------------------
A factorial is written as:
```
x!
```
This evaluates to:
```
x * (x - 1) * (x - 2) * ... (x - (x - 1))
```
Examples
---------------------
```
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
factorial(5) = 120
```

```
factorial(1) = 1
factorial(0) = 1
factorial(-3) = -(3 * 2 * 1) = 6
```
